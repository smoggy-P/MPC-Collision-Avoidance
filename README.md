# MPC-Collision-Avoidance
In this repository we would present you with an implementation of MPC to solve collision avoidance problem for 3D drone.
## Using the code
Firstly clone this repository, then run a simple demo by:
```
git clone https://github.com/smoggy-P/MPC-Collision-Avoidance.git
python3 demo.py
```
You would see a visualization of generated trajectory.
