# MPC-Collision-Avoidance
In this repository we would present you with an implementation of MPC to solve [Collision avoidance for 3D quadrotor](https://github.com/smoggy-P/MPC-Collision-Avoidance/files/8454986/MPC.pdf).
## Dependency
We used several packages in python, here is the list of their version:
```ruby
control: "~> 0.9.1"
cvxpy: "~> 1.1.19"
numpy: "~> 1.19.5"
matplotlib: "~> 3.3.4"
```
## Using the code
Firstly clone this repository, then run a simple demo by:
```
git clone https://github.com/smoggy-P/MPC-Collision-Avoidance.git
python3 demo.py
```
You would see a visualization of generated trajectory.
